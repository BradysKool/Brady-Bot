This is a script that logs into my school's website and web scrapes my grades and sends it as a text to me every morning at 7:30. I used Selenium to do the web scraping to get my grades. Then I used my gmail account from the script and sent it to my phone number using the free mms gateway from my service provider to send it to my phone.

I have hosted this script on a Linux server in the cloud and use the crontab function to run it every morning.
